## Technologies
This website is created with Visual Studio Code using html, css and js. Terminal is used to work with node.js. Files are here in GitHub to be cloned.

## Installation
The output of the project can be seen in the dist on GitHub pages. 
Because this is a Node.js application that runs from a machine and not a browser, we can't deploy this to GitHub pages. The repo needs to be cloned to your own local machine and run it from there.

## Usage
- After cloning the repo, open the whole folder in VS code. Open the terminal and make sure to go to the same path directory of the folder where the files are in.

- Once on the same path directory as the folder, type node app. 
- Then there will be a series of questions about you and the portfolio (you can input as much projects as you like)
